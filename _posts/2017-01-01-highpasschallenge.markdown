<p>All of the rides that I have done in the Pacific Northwest have been organized rides and rides that were meant to be fun. Those rides inlcude the Seattle to Portland in 1 Day, Ride Around Mount Rainier in One Day, Chilly Hilly and the 7 Hills of Kirkland. They have not been races and have not been against the clock. However, I decided to test what I was made of by riding Cascade.org High Pass Challenge. </p>

<p> The High Pas Challenge is a 100+ mile "race" up to the Windy Ridge and Spirit Lake on Mount Saint Helens. The "race" is timed up to Windy Ridge with finishers getting ribbons based on the time it takes to climb up to the top.  Riders getting to the top before 3 hours and 30 minutes re Gold, 4 hours and 30 minutes are Silver, and before 6 hours are Bronze. </p>

<p>

<p>Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the proper page, said: "Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah&mdash;'And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.'"</p>

<p>"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters&mdash;four yarns&mdash;is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what depths of the soul does Jonah's deep sealine sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish's belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God&mdash;never mind now what that command was, or how conveyed&mdash;which he found a hard command. But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do&mdash;remember that&mdash;and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God consists.</p>
